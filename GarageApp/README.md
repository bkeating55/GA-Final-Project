# README
Welcome to GarageApp!

This app was designed to give you a place to keep track of all your
vehicles and log the maintenance required to keep them running safely on the road.

This app was designed using Rails 5.0.

User Stories:

- I want to be able to have my own garage where I can:
  -Keep track of what vehicles I own
  -Edit the vehicle if I trade in or sell it

- I should be able to easily add services that I have performed on my vehicle

- These services should be easy for me to read and easy to access.

Future Improvements:

- I want the Service log to be attached to a vehicle rather than just an index.

- I want to incorporate an API that would allow for visualization of the vehicle
in the "garage."

- I want to use the API to also send recall notices as well as service reminders.

- I would like to have a daily miles tracker and it be able to remind you how many
miles you have left before it is recommended to get an oil change or other vehicle
services such as tire rotations, fluid changes, etc.
